# 🔧 SLUG FIELD ERROR FIXED

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Issue:** KeyError - 'slug' not found in form  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## 🔴 The Error

```
KeyError at /admin/authentication/youtubevideo/add/
"Key 'slug' not found in 'YouTubeVideoForm'. Choices are: ..."
```

**Same error occurred for:**

- `/admin/authentication/youtubevideo/add/` (Add new video)
- `/admin/authentication/youtubevideo/2/change/` (Edit video)
- `/admin/authentication/event/add/` (Add new event)
- `/admin/authentication/event/<id>/change/` (Edit event)

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The `slug` field was listed in **both**:

1. `readonly_fields` - Fields that can't be edited
2. `prepopulated_fields` - Fields that auto-fill from other fields

**A field cannot be both readonly AND prepopulated!**

This caused Django to:

- Exclude `slug` from the form (because it's readonly)
- Try to use `slug` in prepopulated (which doesn't exist in form)
- Throw KeyError

---

## ✅ The Fix

### EventAdmin

**Before:**

```python
readonly_fields = ('views_count', 'created_at', 'updated_at', 'published_at', 'slug')
prepopulated_fields = {'slug': ('name',)}
```

**After:**

```python
readonly_fields = ('views_count', 'created_at', 'updated_at', 'published_at')
prepopulated_fields = {'slug': ('name',)}
```

### YouTubeVideoAdmin

**Before:**

```python
readonly_fields = ('video_id', 'embed_url', 'auto_thumbnail', 'internal_views', 'created_at', 'updated_at', 'slug')
prepopulated_fields = {'slug': ('title',)}
```

**After:**

```python
readonly_fields = ('video_id', 'embed_url', 'auto_thumbnail', 'internal_views', 'created_at', 'updated_at')
prepopulated_fields = {'slug': ('title',)}
```

**Changed:** Removed `'slug'` from `readonly_fields` in both admin classes

## 🎯 What This Means

### Now You Can:

✅ **Add new events** - slug will auto-populate from event name  
✅ **Edit events** - can modify slug if needed  
✅ **Add new videos** - slug will auto-populate from video title  
✅ **Edit videos** - can modify slug if needed

### Slug Behavior:

- **Auto-populates** as you type the title/name
- **Editable** if you want to customize it
- **URL-friendly** (converts spaces to hyphens, removes special chars)
- **Unique** (Django ensures no duplicates)
