**How it works**:

```javascript
// Loads navigation on page ready
fetch("navigation.html")
  .then((response) => response.text())
  .then((html) => {
    document.getElementById("nav-container").innerHTML = html;
  });
```

**Result**: Professional navigation bar at the top of the page with links to all major sections.

- Added hover effects and pause on hover

**Visual Features**:

- 🎨 Grayscale by default, color on hover
- 📏 Scale effect (1.05x) with blue shadow on hover

## ❓ About Video Cards

### Your Request:

> "I want to add moving animations of Card there for videos where videos should be automated playable"

### Current Status:

**No video elements found in index.html currently.**

### Future Implementation:

If you want to add video cards, here's what would be needed:

```html
<!-- Example Video Card with Autoplay -->
<div class="video-card">
  <video autoplay muted loop playsinline>
    <source src="video-url.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
  <div class="video-overlay">
    <h3>Video Title</h3>
    <p>Description</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Recommendations**:

1. Use `autoplay muted loop playsinline` attributes
2. Add poster images for loading states
3. Implement lazy loading for performance
4. Keep black/white/blue color scheme
5. Add play/pause controls for accessibility

**Would you like me to add video cards?** If yes, please provide:

- Video URLs or file paths
- Where to place them (which section)
- How many videos
- Card layout preferences
