# 🧪 Quick Testing Guide - Hackathon Judges & Winners

## ✅ How to Test the Implementation

### 1. Backend API Test
```bash
# Test the hackathons API endpoint
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/auth/hackathons/" | python3 -m json.tool | head -200

# Expected: JSON response with 4 judges and 4 winners, each with complete information
```

### 2. Admin Interface Test

3. Check these pages:
   - **Judges**: http://localhost:8000/admin/authentication/hackathonjudge/
   - **Winners**: http://localhost:8000/admin/authentication/hackathonwinner/

**Expected Results:**
- 4 judges displayed with resume URLs, expertise, years of experience
- 4 winners displayed with resume URLs, GitHub links, demo links, university info

### 3. Frontend Display Test
1. Open browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/frontend/hackathon-detail.html?slug=cybershield-defense-challenge-2025
   ```

2. Scroll down to the "Judges & Mentors" section

### 4. Comment System Test
1. On the same hackathon detail page, scroll to comments section

3. If logged in, verify you can post comments

**Expected Results:**
✅ Comments section displays without errors
✅ Comment system uses correct content_type: "sharxathon"
✅ API calls go to port 8000 (not 8001)

### 5. Database Verification
```bash
# Access Django shell
cd "Backend flow"
python manage.py shell

# Run these commands:
from authentication.models import HackathonJudge, HackathonWinner

# Check judges
judges = HackathonJudge.objects.all()
print(f"Judges count: {judges.count()}")
for judge in judges:
    print(f"- {judge.name}: {judge.expertise[:50]}... ({judge.years_of_experience} years)")
    print(f"  Resume: {judge.resume_url}")
    print(f"  LinkedIn: {judge.linkedin_url}\n")

# Check winners
winners = HackathonWinner.objects.all()
print(f"Winners count: {winners.count()}")
for winner in winners:
    print(f"- {winner.name} ({winner.position}): {winner.university}")
    print(f"  Major: {winner.major}, Graduation: {winner.graduation_year}")
    print(f"  Project: {winner.project_description[:60]}...")
    print(f"  GitHub: {winner.github_url}")
    print(f"  Demo: {winner.demo_url}\n")
```

- ✅ LinkedIn links open in new tab
- ✅ Resume links open in new tab
- ✅ GitHub links open in new tab

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Judges/Winners not showing
**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify data exists
cd "Backend flow"
python manage.py shell
>>> from authentication.models import HackathonJudge, HackathonWinner
>>> HackathonJudge.objects.count()  # Should be 4
>>> HackathonWinner.objects.count()  # Should be 4
```

### Issue: "student_name" field error
**Solution:** Already fixed! The field is called `name`, not `student_name`. The serializer and frontend have been updated.

### Issue: Comment system not working
**Solution:** Check these fixes were applied:
- content_type: "sharxathon" (not "hackathon")
- apiBaseUrl: "http://localhost:8000/api/auth" (not port 8001)

### Issue: New fields not appearing
**Solution:** Verify migration was applied:
```bash
cd "Backend flow"
python manage.py migrate
# Should show: "Applying authentication.0031...OK"
```
