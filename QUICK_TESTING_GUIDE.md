## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Pages don't load

**Fix**: `python manage.py runserver`

### Issue 2: No articles show

**Cause**: API returns empty array  
**Fix**: Add articles in Django admin

### Issue 3: Featured slider empty

**Cause**: No featured articles or no articles at all  
**Fix**: Mark some articles as "featured" in Django admin

### Issue 4: Comments don't load

**Cause**: Comment API endpoint not configured  
**Fix**: Check Django API at `/api/auth/comments/`

**Cause**: `data-page` attribute mismatch

### Issue 6: Images don't show
