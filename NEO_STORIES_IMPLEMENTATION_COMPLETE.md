**Frontend Implementation:**
- Slider container with navigation arrows
- Dot indicators for each featured item
- Supports both images and videos (YouTube embeds)
- "Featured" badge on media and story cards
- Automatic filtering of stories with `is_featured: true`

**Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "featured_screen": {
    "url": "https://...",
    "type": "image|video",
    "is_featured": true
  }
}
```
