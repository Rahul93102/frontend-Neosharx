# 🚀 VERCEL DEPLOYMENT - STATUS UPDATE

## Issue Found & Fixed ✅

### What was wrong:

- Build was creating `dist/output.css` but NOT copying HTML, JavaScript, and asset files
- Only CSS file was in dist/ folder - missing index.html, navigation.html, etc.
- Result: **404 Not Found** on Vercel

### Root Cause:

- The `copy-files-from-to` package wasn't reading build-files.json correctly
- Files weren't being copied to dist/ during build

### Fix Applied:

Updated `build:copy` script in package.json from:

```json
"build:copy": "copy-files-from-to --files.json build-files.json"
```

To:

```json
"build:copy": "cp index.html dist/ && cp -r assets dist/ && cp -r auth dist/ && cp navigation.html dist/ && cp global-auth.js dist/"
```

### Result:

✅ Build now creates complete dist/ folder with:

- dist/index.html (124KB)
- dist/output.css (71KB)
- dist/navigation.html (22KB)
- dist/global-auth.js (8.1KB)
- dist/assets/ (all images)
- dist/auth/ (callback files)

├── navigation.html     ← Navigation component
├── global-auth.js      ← Auth script
├── assets/             ← Images
