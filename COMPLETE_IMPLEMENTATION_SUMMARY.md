## 🎬 YouTube Videos Features

### Uniform Size Implementation:

```css
/* All videos are exactly the same size */
padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 aspect ratio */
```

**Result**: All video cards are identical rectangles regardless of content type (video or short).

### Autoplay Implementation:

```javascript
// Regular Videos
autoplay=1&mute=1&controls=1&modestbranding=1

// Shorts
autoplay=1&mute=1&loop=1&playlist={id}&controls=0
```

**Result**: Videos start playing automatically when page loads (muted for browser compatibility).
