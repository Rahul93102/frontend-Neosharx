# UI Fixes Complete - October 11, 2025 ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Removed "Funky Text" Metadata from tech-detail.html
**Problem**: Unwanted metadata showing "NeoSharX Editorial", "October 5, 2025", "5 min read", "1 views"

**Solution**: 
- Removed the entire metadata display section (author, date, read time, views)
- Removed corresponding JavaScript code that populated these fields
- Now only shows: Category badge, Title, and Summary

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/tech-detail.html` (Lines 106-123 removed, Lines 208-229 simplified)

---

### 2. ✅ Fixed Navigation Not Working
**Problem**: Navigation wasn't loading/clickable on tech-detail.html

**Solution**:
- Changed `<div id="nav-container">` to `<div id="nav-placeholder">`
- This matches the ID expected by `nav-loader.js`
- Navigation now loads properly and all links work

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/tech-detail.html` (Line 69: nav-container → nav-placeholder)

---

### 3. ✅ Added Comments Heading to Projects Section
**Problem**: Comments section in neo-project-detail.html had no heading, making it hard to notice

**Solution**:
- Added "Comments" heading with icon matching the page design
- Now consistent with other sections (Related Projects, etc.)

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/neo-project-detail.html` (Added heading before comments-container)
