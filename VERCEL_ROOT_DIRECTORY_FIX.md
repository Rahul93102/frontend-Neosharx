# 🚨 VERCEL ROOT DIRECTORY FIX - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## THE PROBLEM
Your Vercel deployment is failing because the **Root Directory** is not set correctly!

**Current Status:** Vercel is looking for files in the repository root instead of the `frontend/` folder.

**Error:** All files (CSS, images, HTML, JS) are returning 404 because Vercel can't find them.

## THE SOLUTION - FIX IN VERCEL DASHBOARD

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard
Navigate to: https://vercel.com/dashboard/projects

### Step 2: Find Your Project
Click on: `frontend-neosharx-2uil`

### Step 3: Go to Settings
Click the **"Settings"** tab

### Step 4: Set Root Directory
1. Scroll down to **"Build & Development Settings"**
2. Find **"Root Directory"**
3. **Change from:** `./` (or empty)
4. **Change to:** `frontend`
5. Click **"Save"**

### Step 5: Trigger Redeploy
1. Go back to the **"Deployments"** tab
2. Click the **three dots (...)** on the latest deployment
3. Click **"Redeploy"**

## WHAT THIS FIXES

| Before (Broken) | After (Fixed) |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Root Directory: `./` | Root Directory: `frontend` |
| Vercel looks in repo root | Vercel looks in `frontend/` folder |
| Can't find package.json | Finds `frontend/package.json` |
| Can't find dist/ | Finds `frontend/dist/` |
| 404 errors for all files | All files served correctly |

## VERIFICATION

After redeploy, your website should work:
- ✅ CSS loads: `/output.css` (from `frontend/dist/output.css`)
- ✅ Images load: `/assets/SharXathons.png` (from `frontend/dist/assets/`)
- ✅ Navigation loads: `/navigation.html` (from `frontend/dist/navigation.html`)
- ✅ Auth loads: `/global-auth.js` (from `frontend/dist/global-auth.js`)

## BUILD PROCESS (What Vercel Will Do)

```
Repository Root
├── frontend/           ← Vercel now looks here
│   ├── package.json    ← Found!
│   ├── vercel.json     ← Found!
│   ├── src/input.css   ← Found!
│   ├── index.html      ← Found!
│   ├── assets/         ← Found!
│   └── dist/           ← Created during build
│       ├── output.css
│       ├── index.html
│       ├── navigation.html
│       └── ...
```

## TIMELINE

1. **NOW:** Make the change in Vercel dashboard
2. **+1 min:** Click "Redeploy"
3. **+2-5 min:** Vercel rebuilds with correct root directory
4. **+5 min:** Website live and working! 🎉

## IF STILL BROKEN

If you still get 404s after this fix:

1. Check Vercel build logs for errors
2. Verify the redeploy completed successfully
3. Make sure "Root Directory" is exactly `frontend` (lowercase, no slashes)

## QUICK CHECKLIST

- [ ] Go to Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Click your project
- [ ] Go to Settings
- [ ] Set Root Directory to `frontend`
- [ ] Save changes
- [ ] Redeploy
- [ ] Wait 2-5 minutes
- [ ] Test website

## SUPPORT

If this doesn't work, check the build logs in Vercel and share any error messages.
